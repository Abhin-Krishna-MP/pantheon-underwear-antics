### Project Description
A gloriously useless web app that lets you register your undergarments, track how many times it‚Äôs been washed, predict its lifespan, and compete on a leaderboard for the most loyal (and most frequently washed) pair. Comes with customizable undergarment avatars because‚Ä¶ why not?



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People around the world are plagued by a lack of knowledge about the lifespan and cleanliness stats of their underwear. How many washes until it retires? How many years of loyal service has it given? No one knows. This is clearly an urgent problem that demands immediate attention.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A web app that treats each pair of undergarments like a celebrity athlete ‚Äî with a profile, wash history, age tracker, and public leaderboard. Every wash, every day of service, and every hole is tracked, celebrated, and sometimes mourned with a dramatic eulogy.
