# Mock Functionality Test Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing the Frontend-Only Application

Your Pantheon Underwear Antics application has been successfully converted to a frontend-only application with mock authentication and data storage. Here's how to test it:

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios

### 1. Authentication Testing

**Mock Users Available:**
- Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`
- Username: `user1`, Password: `password123`
- Username: `user2`, Password: `password123`

**Test Steps:**
1. Click "Login" on the homepage
2. Try logging in with the mock credentials above
3. Try registering a new user
4. Test logout functionality

### 2. Undergarment Management

**Test Steps:**
1. Log in with any account
2. Add a new undergarment using the form
3. Wash the undergarment multiple times to unlock achievements
4. Retire an undergarment
5. Check the leaderboard to see all users' undergarments

### 3. Data Persistence

**Test Steps:**
1. Add some undergarments while logged in
2. Refresh the page - data should persist
3. Log out and log back in - data should still be there
4. Try different user accounts - each should have separate data

### 4. Leaderboard Functionality

**Test Steps:**
1. Log in as different users and add undergarments
2. Wash undergarments to increase wash counts
3. Check the leaderboard tab to see all users' undergarments
4. Verify the sorting by wash count
